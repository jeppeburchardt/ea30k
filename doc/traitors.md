# Traitor Legions

## Night Lords

>"Show your enemy mercy and he shall one day seek vengeance upon you for every petty, imagine slight. Mercy is therefore a weakness; a crime waiting to be born. Mercy I have long since expunged, both from myself and my legion."
>
>The Night Haunter

Even before the Isstvaan Drop Site Massacre, the Night Lords were renegade in all but name, having entirely devoted themselves to the arts of terror and murder. The Legion's Primarch Konrad Curze is the master of the unheralded strike from the least anticipated corner, an attack delivered with such brutality and wanton cruelty entire planetary populations were brought to their knees in abject surrender. Never given to mercy, few who oppose the Night Lords ever live to tell the tale, unless they are allowed by design to escape to sow the seeds of dread still further. Given the dark demeanour of the Legion, it takes an equally ruthless leader to rein in it's propensity to atrocity, at least until such time as it is called for.

The following formations are available to a Night Lords army in addition to those in the core legion army list.

## World Eaters

> "Monuments are dust, tales merely words, soon forgotten, but blood... blood is forever."
>
> The Primarch Angron

Of all the Space Marine Legions in the Emperor's service, the World Eater's were among the most feared, the whisper of their coming was enough to quell rebellion and send armies to flight in terror. Tales of their predations and massacres were numberless, and their reputation was as the Emperor's war hounds, as such a name they once carried -- beasts, butchers and madmen whose fury was fuelled by bloodshed, and was such that no sane warrior would stand willingly against them.

The following formations are available to a World Eaters army in addition to or in place of those already in the core legion army list.

## Emperors Children

_"Pride Goeth Before Abandon  
Vanity Goeth Before Weakness  
VainGlory Goeth Before the Fall."_

The Cantos of Proverbs  
Aprocrypha Terra

The Emperor's Children have always striven to be exemplars above all others in the arts of war; paragons of martial virtue and excellence, scorning those who do not meet their own, perhaps unattainable, standards. This led them to seek perfection in war as a fluid, lightning-quick force whose battles were preordained victories brought about by a combination of acute strategic planning and flawless execution. Their attitudes and manner led some to name them as arrogant and vainglorious long before the Heresy, but the Legion's warriors were always ready to answer such slight with blood.

## Iron Warriors

_"Victory is not an abstract concept, it is the equation at the heart of strategy. Victory is the willingness to expend lives and munitions in attack, overmatching the defenders reserves of manpower and ordnance. As long as my Iron Warriors are willing to pay any price in the pursuit of victory, we shall never be defeated."_

Perturabo, Master of the Iron Warriors

The Iron Warriors are the grim faced, cold hearted masters of the science of war, the exemplars of strength and discipline turned exclusively to the destruction of an enemy. The Legion is commanded by its Lord Primarch as an extension of his own mind and body, the will of each Legionary utterly sublimated to his conception of victory. More so than in any other Legion, the life of each warrior is secondary to his duty, as much a resource to be expended in the relentless calculus of war as bolt shell or lascannon charge. Guided by such doctrines, the Iron Warriors are the most relentless and dogged siege warriors in the ranks of the Legiones Astartes and countless fortresses have been reduced to ashes under their guns throughout the Great Crusade.

## Death Guard

>_"Pain is an illusion of the senses, fear an illusion of the mind, beyond these, only death waits as silent judge over all."_
>
> The Primarch Mortarion

The Death Guard are stalwart and implacable fighters who have made a specialty of both endurance under the harshest circumstances and of overcoming the most nightmarish and inhospitable war zones. Their name is a byword for unflinching determination and victory through bloody, gruelling attrition when all else fails, as well as for expertise in the darker arts of warfare, such as the use of bio-alchemical and radiation weaponry.

The following units replace or are available to a Death Guard Army in addition to the core legion list. A Deathguard Army cannot take a Legion Assault Marine Detachment as a Line Detachment.

## Word Bearers

_"Mankind's stoicism in the face of suffering is founded on its ignorance of the alternatives."_

Erebus, First Chaplain of the Word Bearers

Where once the XVIIth Legion brought the light of the Emperor to benighted humanity, now the Word Bearers bring the blinding darkness of Old Night. No longer drive by duty or honour, but by the thirst for forbidden lore and undeserved power, they seek to bind the Warp itself and enslave its denizens to their will. When the Word Bearers march to war, the fabric of reality is distorted and the dread things of the Abyss march at their side. To stand against the Word Bearers is to invite insanity, death and, unknown to most yes the worst fate of all, the damnation of the eternal soul.

## Sons of Horus

_"For a warrior, the only crime is cowardice."_

Horus Lupercal

In the case of the Sons of Horus, the combat doctrines of this most aggresive Legion were those of the application of overwhelming force directed to where the foe was weakest. These shattering blows were used to utterly destroy enemy command cadres, vital strategic support structures and wreak terrible slaughter upon the pride of an enemy's forces, often turning the tide of an entire conflict with a single, well placed and savage attack. Even on a personal level, the Sons of Horus took this merciless doctrine to heart and, like the wolves they were once named for, were swift to exploit a foe's weakness, surrounding and brutally tearing apart an outnumbered or exposed enemy before they could recover from the shock of an assault.

## Alpha Legion

Of all the Legiones Astartes, the least is known for certain of the Alpha Legion. The annals of the Great Crusade make mention of the Legion, but invariably each entry contradicts some other. All that is known is that the warriors of the Alpha Legion are the masters of misdirection and guile. Most foes have no inkling they are even fighting before the Alpha Legion's master stratagems cause their defences to collapse beneath them, torn apart from within so that when the final overwhelming attack comes, the enemy's defeat is total.
