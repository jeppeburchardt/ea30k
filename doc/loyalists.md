# Loyalist Legions


## Iron Hands

_"Rest? We were not made to rest; we go on, unflinching, unstoppable, unending in our strength. The Emperor did not make us for such mortal concerns as hearth and home, vanity or contemplation; we are his engines of war, his hammers, beating out the fabric of existence into a vessel fit for Mankind to inhabit."_

Ferrus Manus

The Iron Hands are the masters of the engines of war, wielding weapons and armoured tanks with the skill a master swordsman might wield a blade. Proud and relentless, the Legion has fought for many years at the forefront of the Great Crusade, and seen victories uncounted, though many have labelled them as callous and as inhuman as the machines they employ with such devastating skill.

The following formations are available to an Iron Hands army in addition to those in the core legion army list.

## Raven Guard

> "Swear with me now, my children, to follow me where ever this road may lead. Swear to show no mercy to the Traitors. Swear to slay them with hatred in your heart. Swear to excise this cancer that Horus has nourished in the heart of the Imperium. Swear to bring the Imperial Truth to the galaxy. Swear that we will never fail again."
> 
> *Lord Corax*

The Raven Guard are equal parts light and dark - quick to exact justice and retribution upon the tyrant and the oppressor by striking from the shadows with lightning speed and shocking strength. The annals of the Great Crusade tell relatively few tales of the numerous great deeds the Legion has enacted, for it has ever shunned the glare of adulation. Though the master of the full spectrum of war, the Raven Guard Legion favours the tactics of patience, guile and subtlety. It is adept at reconnaissance and infiltration, of identifying its foe's weakest point and then rapidly striking at that point with precisely applied force.

The following formations are available to a Raven Guard army in addition to those in the core legion army list.

## Salamanders

> "Without wisdom, skill cannot be focussed. Without skill, strength cannot be brought to bear. > Without strength, wisdom may not be applied."
> 
> _The Teachings of the Promethean Cult_

The Salamanders are the exemplars of forge-wrought duty, masters of artifice and possessed of a fearsome and uncompromising sense of honour. They stand for toil and sacrifice, bearing arms and armour forged to the highest possible standards and often by the Legionaries who bear them into battle. The Legion wields the tools of the smith as weapons of war, bring heat, iron and raw strength of arms to strike down all those who would deny the Imperial Truth or attempt to undermine the Imperium of Man.

The following formations are available to a Salamanders army in addition to those in the core legion army list.

## Ultramarines

_To plunder, to slaughter, to steal, these things have long been misnamed empire. Ours is the better way; after we conquer, we shall rebuild, after we destroy, we will create order. Where once was ruin and slavery, we shall bring civilisation and the Imperial Truth. To those who oppose this great ideal, we will bring the peace of swift ending._

Roboute Guilliman

The Lexus Ultramar

The Ultramarines Legion prosecutes the Emperor's wars with reason, discipline and resolve, every warrior striving to match the example of their Primarch. The most numerous of the Space Marine Legions, they have long formed the bulwark of the Imperium's domains in the Galactic East.

The following formations are available to a Ultramarines army in addition to those in the core legion army list.

## Imperial Fists

> "Doubt is the greatest weakness. It can shatter the strongest of walls without a single shot being fired, and fell the mightiest champions before even a sword is drawn"
> 
> *Rogal Dorn, Primarch of the Imperial Fists*

The Legionaries of the VIIth Legion are known as the stoic praetorians of Terra, the embodiment of all that the Great Crusade stands for. They are loyal, disciplined and methodical, and masters of both the attack and the defence. As the Imperium expands ever outwards, so the crusaders of the Imperial Fists are to be found at the very leading edge of Compliance. Then, in the wake of victory, the Imperial Fists construct might fortresses that are as much garrisons against recidivism as they are beacons of Unification, the noblest exemplars of the highest ideals and aspirations of Humanity.

The following formations are available to a Imperial Fists army in addition to those in the core legion army list.

## Blood Angels

The Blood Angels, of all the warriors of the Legiones Astartes, evidenced perhaps the greatest degree of transformation of their flesh from their human origins to the Space Marines they would become. This transformation's effects were even more pronounced and more fundamental than that of the Space Wolves or the Salamanders, both of which featured unique stigmata of their own.

The following formations are available to a Blood Angels army in addition to those in the core legion army list.

## Space Wolves

By the late Great Crusade era, the Space Wolves Legion had strongly deviated from the Principia Belicosa's definition of the Legiones Astartes structure and organisation. The Legion's host was now broken down into a shifting array of warrior bands beholden strongly to the personal authority of a particular company commander and below them to a series of tributary sub-commanders, known variously as 'Wolf Lord' (Jar!) or 'Claw Leader' (Thegn), regardless of their notional or accorded rank within the Imperium's order of battle.

The following formations are available to a Space Wolves army in addition to those in the core legion army list. A Space Wolves Army cannot select a Libarian as part of a Centurion Upgrade.
