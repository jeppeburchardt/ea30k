# Daemons Of The Ruinstorm

## Introduction

Daemons Of The Ruinstorm armies have a **Strategy Rating of 2**. All detachments have an **Initiative rating of 2+**. For each Daemonic Horde detachment taken, one Follower of Chaos detachment (of the same god affiliation or undivided) may be selected. 0-1 Greater Daemon Hordes (up to one Greater Daemon Horde per god affiliated Daemonic Horde) may be selected, so long as a Daemonic Horde detachment of the same god affiliation has been selected.  
Daemonic Horde detachments and Followers of Chaos detachments may take any number of Gifts of Chaos. Each upgrade may only be selected once per detachment.

## Special Rules


### Berserk

A unit with the Berserk characteristic may double it's movement distance when conducting an Engage order. Additionally, formations containing Berserk units can not claim objectives under the GT scenario.


### Instability

The power of the Warp is fickle and unpredictable, even for those born of its seething currents. Any Daemonic Hordes detachment that fails an initiative test, for any reason, immediately loses 1D3 Lesser Daemons (INF). These losses do not cause any Blast markers, though the detachment may break if this causes them to have more Blast markers than units. Detachments without Lesser Daemons (INF) are still subject to this rule though, in practice, it has no effect on them.

### Chaos Gate

Chaos Gates are breaches in the walls of reality that allow the forces of Chaos direct access from their foul realms. A Chaos Gate included in the army allows the Chaos player to pick up to three other detachments, and keep them within the Warp instead of deploying them normally. Any detachments that are kept within the Warp may enter play via the Chaos Gate, by taking an action that allows them to make a move, and then measuring their first move from the centre of the Chaos Gate objective marker. No more than one detachment may travel through a Chaos Gate each turn.

### Daemonic Assault

Spilling from rents in the fabric of reality, a daemonic assault can come from any angle giving the defenders no possibility of forming a coherent defence. Before deployment, the daemon player may nominate one detachment in their army per full thousand points (or if used as allies, one detachment per thousands points of allied points allotment) to deploy by teleport. These detachments may only enter play from the second turn and may contain any units, with the restriction of only containing a single greater daemon unit.
