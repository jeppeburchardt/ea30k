# Imperial Militia

## Introduction

Imperial Militia armies have a Strategy Rating of 2. All Imperial Militia formations have an Initiative rating of 2+. An Imperial Militia player may be spend up to 1/3 of its total points value on Allies/Lords of War. When selected as allies for another army, some armies will state the restriction Imperial Militia (Traitor Militia). When an Imperial Militia (Traitor Militia) army is selected, at least one detachment must take the _Traitors_ provenance upgrade.

## Special Rules


### Berserk

Some units are taken with a blood rage before or during a battle, this fury makes them nearly uncontrollable, thirsting for wanton death and destruction. A unit with the _Berserk_ characteristic may double it's movement distance when conducting an _Engage_ order.

### Dedicated War Engine Transports

Gorgon Armoured Transports may only transport units from their own formation. The standard rules for war engine transports do not apply to them when using the Imperial Militia army list.

### Discipline Masters / Rogue Psykers

An Imperial Militia army may include one Discipline Master character per 500 points, or part thereof, in the army. The Discipline Masters do not cost points. If a player elects to take Discipline Master characters, they must be added to the army prior to the start of the battle before set up. If the army includes a Force Commander then the first Discipline Master must be attached to formation containing the Force Commander. If a Force Commander is not present in the Army, then the first Discipline Master must be placed in the most expensive Imperial Militia Line Formation. Any further Discipline Masters may be attached to any other Imperial Militia formations. You may not include more than one Discipline Master per formation. You may not add a Discipline Master to an Imperial Navy or allied formation. If you have more Discipline Masters than formations, any excess are lost. A Rogue Psyker may be exchanged for a Discipline Master in a formation that has taken the Traitors Provenance upgrade.

### Provenance

Certain formations may purchase a Provenance upgrade. Only two types of provenance may be applied across the army. Any eligible formation may purchase one of the two provenance selections. The provenance upgrade will modify the unit values for all infantry (INF) units in the formation in one of the following ways:  
**Warrior Elite: +1 Firefight (FF) value  
Survivors of the Dark Age: +1 Armour save (Armour) value  
Feral Warriors: +1 Close Combat (CC) value  
Traitors: gain the Berserk special rule. Ogryn Brute Squad units chosen in a formation with the Traitors Provenance must choose the Chaos Spawn Mutations option.**

For example, an Inducted Levy squad has purchased the Feral Warriors upgrade. All of the levy Auxiliary units in the formation will modify their regular (CC) value of 6+ to (CC) 5+.

_Exploratory Augury Web._ Friendly units entering play via the _Teleport_ special rule within 15cm of a friendly unit with the _Exploratory Augury Web_ do not roll for blast markers.
