# Legio Custodes

## Introduction

The Legio Custodes are the bodyguards and sworn protectors of the Emperor, his chosen emissaries, and, should the need arise, his most deadly executioners. Legio Custodes armies have a strategy rating of 1+ and Legio Custodes formations have an initiative rating of 1+. Legio Custodes can spend up to 1/2 of the total points value on Allies and/or Lords of War.

## Special Rules

### The Emperor's Chosen.

The Legio Custodes are the Emperor's elite, forged in his image, they gain the following special rules:

*   It takes 2 Blast markers to suppress a Legio Custodes unit or kill a unit in a broken formation (ignoring any leftover Blast markers).
*   Legio Custodes formations are only considered broken if they have 2 blast markers per unit in the formation (as opposed to the standard one blast marker per unit).
*   Legio Custodes formations only count half the number of blast markers in assault resolution (rounding down â€“ note that assault resolution will not receive +1 for having no Blast markers if the formation has 1 Blast marker before rounding down).
*   When a broken Legion Custodes formation rallies, it receives a number of Blast markers equal to the number of units, rather than half this number. Legio Custodes with the Leader special ability remove 2 Blast markers instead of 1.
*   Legio Custodes formations halve the number of hackdowns suffered when a formation loses an assault.
