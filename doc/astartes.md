# Legion Astartes


## Introduction

Legion Astartes armies have a **Strategy rating of 5** and Legion Astartes formations have an **Initiative rating of 1+**. Up to 1/3 of the army's total points value may be spent on Allies and/or Lords of War. A player may choose to have their army represent one of the unique legions present during the Horus Heresy, a player may only select one unique Legion. The Primarch and unique unit choices become available to the player for inclusion in their army.

## Special Rules

### Legion Astartes

Legion Astartes are renowned for their tenacity and bravery. This is represented by the following changes to the standard rules, which apply to all Legion Astartes units.

*   It takes 2 Blast markers to suppress a Legion Astartes unit or kill a unit in a broken formation (ignore any leftover Blast markers).
*   Legion Astartes formations are only considered broken if they have 2 blast markers per unit in the formation (as opposed to the standard blast marker per unit).
*   Legion Astartes formations only count half the number of blast markers in assault resolution (rounding down – note that assault resolution will not receive +1 for having no Blast markers if the formation has 1 Blast marker before rounding down).
*   When a broken Legion Astartes formation rallies, it receives a number of Blast markers equal to the number of units, rather than half this number. Legion Astartes with the Leader special ability remove 2 Blast markers instead of 1.
*   Unlike Epic Armageddon 40,000 Space Marine's And They Shall Know No Fear (ATSKNF), Legion Astartes formations do not halve the number of hackdowns suffered when that formation loses an assault.


### Exploratory Augury Web

Enemy units entering the game via the _Planetfall_ special rule within 15cm of an opposing unit with the _Exploratory Augury Web_ special rule must roll a D6 for each unit in in the detachment, taking a blast marker for each 1 rolled. Friendly units entering play via the _Teleport_ special rule within 15cm of a friendly unit with the _Exploratory Augury Web_ do not roll for blast markers.

### Radiation

Certain units are armed with radiological ammunition. Inimical to flesh, radiological weapons that hit reduce the target unit's saving throw by 1. This modifier only applies to hits generated using the AP value of a weapon profile.

### Legion Transports
The cost of the detachment includes enough Rhino transport vehicles to transport it and any upgrades that have been taken. Determine the number of Rhinos needed after all upgrades have been purchased. The number of Rhinos will always be the minimum needed to carry the detachment; you can’t take extra vehicles. Note that some detachments don’t receive Rhinos, usually because they can’t fit into them. Detachments that can take Rhinos will be noted as having ‘plus transport’ in the unit’s section of the army list below. You don’t have to take Rhinos if you don’t want to. If you’d rather field the formation on foot instead, so it can act as a garrison for example, or be transported in a Thunderhawk Gunship, then you may do so. Alternatively you may give the formation the Drop Assault upgrade at no extra cost, noting that to use the Drop Pod or Dread Claw you require a Spacecraft to _Planetfall_ the formation..
