# Solar Auxilia

## Introduction

Solar Auxilia armies have a **Strategy Rating of 3**. All formations have an **Initiative rating of 2+**. Two Solar Auxilia Support Detachments may be chosen for each Solar Auxilia Line Detachment. Each detachment may purchase up to three upgrades, each upgrade can only be chosen once per detachment.  
Up to 1/3 of the army's points may be spent on Allies or Lords Of War.

## Special Rules

### Transports

Dracosan Armoured Transport and Stormlord units may only transport units from their own formation. I.e. the rules for War Engine transports do not apply to them when using the Solar Auxilia army list.

### Legate Commander

A Solar Auxilia army may include one Legate Commander character per 500 points, or part thereof, in the army. The Legate Commanders do not cost any points. Legate Commander units may be added to the army at the start of the battle before either side sets up. If the army includes a Lord Marshall, then the first Legate Commander must be attached to the Lord Marshall's formation. Any further Legate Commanders may be attached to any other formations. You may not include more than one Legate Commander per formation. You may not add a Legate Commander to an Imperial Navy or allied formation. If you have more Legate Commanders than formations, any excess is lost.
