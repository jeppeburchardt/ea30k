# Knight Household

## Introduction

Knight Household armies have a **Strategy Rating of 3**. All formations have an **Initiative rating of 2**, however, Knight Household formations receive a +1 modifier to their action test when carrying out an engage action, and a +1 modifier to their rally test. For each Knight Household Line Detachment, you may select two Knight Household Support Detachments. Detachments may choose any number of upgrades, however each upgrade can only be chosen once per detachment.

## Special Rules

### Ion Gauntlet

 Grants a 4+ save vs Normal, MW & TK shooting and FF hits and a 5+ save against Normal, MW and TK CC hits. Each point of TK damage must be saved. Failed saves may use RA rerolls against the Knights armour if not negated by TK, MW or Lance special rules. May not be used in a crossfire.  

### Ion Shield

Grants a 4+ save vs Normal, MW & TK shooting and FF hits. Each point of TK damage must be saved. Failed saves may use RA rerolls against the Knights armour if not negated by TK, MW or Lance special rules. May not be used in a crossfire.
